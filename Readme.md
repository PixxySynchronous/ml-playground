# PRISM ML Models

This repository is a collection of my machine learning and deep learning models.

The goal of this repo is to act as a central lab where I implement, test, and document different architectures and learning approaches.

All code is written with detailed inline comments explaining:
- model structure
- training logic
- math intuition
- implementation decisions

This is meant to be both a working archive and a learning reference.

## Current Models

- Multiclass ANN classifier  
- Nonlinear regression model  
- VGG16 transfer learning / fine-tuning pipeline  
- U-Net image segmentation model

Each folder contains:
- model code
- training pipeline
- evaluation logic
- notes and explanations

## Philosophy

This repository focuses on clarity over cleverness.

Every model is implemented step-by-step with readable code and explanations so that the training process is transparent and reproducible.

The intent is to build a growing library of models that can be reused, extended, and studied.

## Roadmap

More models and experiments will be added over time, including:

- CNN architectures
- advanced transfer learning
- optimization experiments
- evaluation pipelines
- model comparison studies
- additional segmentation architectures

This repo will evolve as a long-term ML playground.
